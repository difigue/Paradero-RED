# Paradero RED

Paradero RED is a simple and easy-to-use Apple Shortcut that allows users to get information about buses and their estimated arrival times at a bus stop entered by the user.

It uses the [APIs de Transporte PÃºblico en Santiago](https://github.com/xorcl/api-red) by [xorcl](https://github.com/xorcl).
